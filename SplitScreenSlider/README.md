# Split Screen Slider
Although this was a quick tutorial, I still probably need to understand how to use the transform in CSS. This tutorial was also helpful as it refrained from using JQuery and used purely vanilla CSS and HTML. I think I learn more doing just pure HTML and CSS. The effect of this slider is incredible and I can see myself using this in the future. Perhaps on my own website.
