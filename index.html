                    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwRZYuxybsc' target='_blank'>Deep Sea VR</a>: another attempt at a VR game in which the user has to locate keys among the deep sea to proceed to the next level. The link provided was a promotional video I had to make but we ended up making the environment brighter to make it easier for the player. Music used is the same as the one used for Microsoft Surface Studio. (I really liked the song so I thought why not :P).
