Whenever I learn something new about web development, I try to add it to my personal website.  

## Current website goals:  
1. Improve visuals on projects
2. Add something that is cool (Interaction with the site visitor maybe?)
3. Hide my Firebase info? (is that sensitive info? I feel like it is)
4. Profit  
  
Might also have to consult someone to evaluate my code and stuff.
