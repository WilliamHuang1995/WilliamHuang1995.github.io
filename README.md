Whenever I learn something new about web development, I try to add it to my personal website.  

## Current website goals:  
1. Improve visuals on projects
2. Add something that is cool (Interaction with the site visitor maybe?)
3. Hide my Firebase info? (is that sensitive info? I feel like it is)
4. Profit  

I have a trello page for this.
  
Might also have to consult someone to evaluate my code and stuff. 

For this website to run properly, you have to install typed.js

Do the following:</br>
```
npm install typed.js
```
**Make sure you run this command at the Project Root!**
